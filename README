Project Manager: Andrey Andreev 
Faculty Number:  62173

The main target of this project is to show good practices in OOP by showing well designed api architecture with good code encapsulation. 

namespace API:
All the classes that are used are implemented in a namespace API as for better code encapsulation

classes :

DatabaseManager:
The class that connects CLI with the database API.

Database:
This class is used as a container for tables.

Table:
This class is used as a container for  rows all following the table's schema.

Row:
This class is used as a container for cells.

Cell:
This class is used as a primitive database value.

Mixed:
A flexible primitive supporting int,float and string conversion in one.


Serializable:
This abstract class offers interface for seriallization used in Table,Row,Cell classes for serialization to string value.

Query (Unary/Binary):
This abstract class offers a model for quering in one or between two tables. All the query classes are encapsulated in namespace Queries.

Exceptions:

All classes use exceptions to indicate different API errors. All exception classes are encapsulated in namespace Exception.
